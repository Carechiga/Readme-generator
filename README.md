## Description

It can be tricky and annoying to create a descriptive and professional Readme with every project, that's where this readme Generator comes in.
This application takes the headache and hassle out of creating a readme after all your hard work has been completed on your application.
Every application needs the proper documention, this readme generator ensure that no critical information is ommited and that it will be presented in a professional format.
While working on this project it was necesary to learn the proper format for a professional README. In addition, it allowed me to gain familiarity with the inquirer node package, and how to build an interactive program using just the console
